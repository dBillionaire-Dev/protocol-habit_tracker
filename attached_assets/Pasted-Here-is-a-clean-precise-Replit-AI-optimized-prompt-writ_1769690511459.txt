Here is a **clean, precise, Replit-AI–optimized prompt**, written so the AI focuses on **implementation only**, keeps your **existing styles**, and follows the **image exactly**.

You can copy-paste this directly into **Replit AI**.

---

## Replit AI Prompt

Use the attached UI screenshot as the **exact reference**.
**Do not change colors, spacing, fonts, shadows, or component styles.**
Only implement layout and logic changes using existing UI patterns.

---

### 1. Streak Card Layout (Side-by-Side)

Update the **Streak card** so that its contents are displayed **side by side**, not stacked vertically.

Specifically:

* Current Streak and Longest Streak should appear **horizontally next to each other**
* Match the visual layout shown in the reference image
* Do not introduce new components or styling
* Only adjust layout structure (flex/grid)

---

### 2. Show Habit Streak on Each Habit Card

Each individual **habit card** must display its own streak, exactly as shown in the image.

For every habit card:

* Display:

  * 🔥 X day streak (or similar existing indicator)
* The streak must be:

  * Habit-specific
  * Calculated independently per habit
* Avoidance habits:

  * Count streak based on days the habit was not logged
* Streak should update without affecting other habits

Do not duplicate logic unnecessarily. Reuse the existing streak calculation.

---

### 3. Move “Initialize Protocol” Button

Relocate the **Initialize Protocol** button:

* Move it **below the Day Confirmation card**
* Button width must:

  * Not be larger than the Day Confirmation card
  * Align naturally with the card layout
* Keep the same button style and behavior
* Only change placement, not appearance

---

### 4. Authentication Improvements

Extend the existing authentication system to support:

#### Email Authentication

* Sign up with email and password
* Sign in with email and password

#### Google Authentication

* Sign up with Google
* Sign in with Google

Requirements:

* Use Supabase Authentication
* Persist user sessions
* Ensure habits and streaks are tied to authenticated users
* Do not change existing auth UI styling
* Add new auth options using current button patterns

---

### 5. General Constraints

* Do not redesign anything
* Do not introduce new colors or typography
* Keep PWA behavior intact
* Maintain existing state and data flow
* Implement only what is described above

---

### Goal

Match the behavior and layout shown in the reference image **exactly**, while keeping the app visually unchanged.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Break this into **Replit AI step-by-step tasks**
* Write **exact Supabase auth config**
* Provide **streak calculation logic** optimized for avoidance habits
* Help you refactor streak logic into a reusable hook

Just tell me.
