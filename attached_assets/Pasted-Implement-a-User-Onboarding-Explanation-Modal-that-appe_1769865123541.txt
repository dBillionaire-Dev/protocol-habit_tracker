Implement a **User Onboarding / Explanation Modal** that appears on login and explains how the app works.
This is **not a Terms & Conditions**, but a **clear behavioral guide** for first-time and returning users.

**Do not change existing visual styles.**
Reuse existing modal, card, button, and typography components.

---

### 1. When the Modal Appears

* Show this modal:

  * On **first login**
  * On subsequent logins **unless the user disables it**
* The modal must appear **after authentication**, not before

---

### 2. “Don’t Show Again” Logic

* Include a checkbox or toggle:

  * Label: **“Don’t show this again”**
* When enabled:

  * Store the preference persistently (Supabase user metadata or user settings table)
  * The modal must **never appear again** unless manually reset
* Default state:

  * Unchecked (modal shows)

---

### 3. Modal Content (Exact Explanation Text)

Display the following content clearly, using sections or cards (no new styling).

---

#### Welcome

**Welcome to the Habit Protocol System**

This app is built to enforce discipline, not just track habits.
Everything works on **protocols, streaks, debt, and daily confirmation windows**.

---

#### Habit Types

**There are two types of habits:**

**1. Building Habits**
These are habits you must actively do.
Examples: studying, coding, exercising.

* You must execute the habit’s protocol within its time window
* Executing a protocol:

  * Increases your streak
  * Reduces any existing debt
* Missing a protocol:

  * Breaks the streak
  * Increases debt

---

**2. Avoidance Habits**
These are habits you must avoid completely.
Examples: no junk food, no gambling, no porn.

* You do not log actions for these habits
* If you avoid the habit for the entire day:

  * The day is confirmed as a **Clean Day**
  * Your streak increases
* If you perform the habit:

  * The streak breaks immediately
  * Debt increases

---

#### Day Confirmation Window

Every day has a **confirmation window**.

* When the window is open:

  * You will see “Window Open” with a countdown timer
* During this time:

  * Building habits are confirmed as completed
  * Avoidance habits are confirmed as clean days

Missing the confirmation window may affect your streak and debt.

---

#### Streak System

* Each habit has its **own streak**
* Streaks are:

  * Habit-specific
  * Independent of other habits
* Longest streaks:

  * Are stored permanently
  * Do not reset when you break a streak

---

#### Debt System

Debt represents missed responsibility.

* Debt increases when:

  * A protocol is missed
  * An avoidance habit is violated
* Debt decreases when:

  * Protocols are executed
  * Clean days are confirmed

Debt is tracked **per habit**, not globally.

---

#### Final Note

This app rewards **consistency**, not perfection.
The goal is accountability, awareness, and long-term discipline.

---

### 4. Modal Actions

At the bottom of the modal:

* **Primary button:** “I Understand” (closes modal)
* Optional secondary action:

  * “Don’t show again” checkbox (if not already shown inline)

---

### 5. Technical Constraints

* Do not redesign or restyle anything
* Do not block the app after dismissal
* Ensure preference persists across sessions and devices
* Keep implementation minimal and clean

---

### Goal

Ensure every user clearly understands:

* How building habits work
* How avoidance habits work
* How streaks, debt, and confirmation windows function

Without forcing them to read legal terms.
